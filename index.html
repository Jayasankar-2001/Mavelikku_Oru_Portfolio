                        I'm the grandson of Prahlada and a descendant of sage Kashyapa. There are many versions of my legend in ancient 
                        texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas. According to Hindu mythology, I was 
                        banished beneath the Earth into the patala or the netherworld by the Vamana Avatar of Lord Vishnu <br /> <br /> 
                        In Hinduism, I'm considered one of the Chiranjivi, a group of seven immortals. It is believed that I will 
                        become the King of Swarga (Heaven) in the next yuga. In Kerala, I'm considered to be the noblest and 
                        most prosperous ruler, who transformed his kingdom into a heavenly place. My legend is a major part of the annual 
                        festival Onam in the state of Kerala, and Balipratipada (the fourth day of Deepavali and first day of Kartika month) 
                        festival in North India & Tulunadu

                Onam is the national festival of Kerala. Celebrated in the month of Chingam, it starts 
                from Atham and lasts for 10 days till Ponnonam. Thiruvonam celebrations evoke a wave of 
                nostalgia in Keralites and are celebrated by everyone irrespective of religion and caste.
                 After the harsh month of Karkidakam comes Chingam, offering the hope of prosperity to farmers, 
                 making Onam a harvest festival.<br /><br />
                 It is a time when the entire state is decked up with Athapookkalam and lights. Visitors to Kerala 
                 during the festive season have the opportunity to experience the hospitality and culture of the 
                 state on a first-hand basis. With the boat races, Onasadhya, Athachamayam, Pulikali, Kummattikali, 
                 Thumbi Thullal and Onam Sadya, the festival also showcases artistic and cultural diversity.<br /><br />
                 Legend has it that Mahabali, the mythical beloved king of Kerala, visits his subjects on the day of 
                 Thiruvonam after ascending from the netherworld. Mahabali, a devotee of Lord Vishnu, was the son of 
                 Virochan and the grandson of Prahalad. He was a righteous and charitable man and treated all his 
                 subjects equally. There was no poverty, crime or cruelty during his rule. Despite Mahabali being a 
                 demon king, the state was at its most glorious phase and his people adored him. Mahabali’s fame grew 
                 with each passing day which enraged the devas. Afraid of losing power, they begged Lord Vishnu to aid 
                 them in stopping Mahabali.<br /><br />
                 As a result, Lord Vishnu in his Vamana Avatar (a Brahmin avatar) visited Mahabali, who was doing yagna 
                 for Lord Vishnu’s grace. Upon seeing the poor Brahmin boy, Mahabali asked what he desired. The boy 
                 responded that he needed land which could be covered in three steps. Mahabali granted the boy’s wish. 
                 He began to grow in size, covering the entire universe with the first two steps. Mahabali then realised 
                 that it was no ordinary boy before him but Lord Vishnu himself. Seeing that there was no more land left, 
                 the king bowed before the boy, offering his head for the next step. Satisfied by the king's devotion, Lord 
                 Vishnu blessed Mahabali and sent him to Pathala or the netherworld, with permission to visit his subjects 
                 once every year. The place where this incident is believed to have taken place was given the name Trikalkkara 
                 which was later changed to Thrikkakara.<br /><br />
                 The incident is said to have occurred on the star sign of Thiruvonam in the month of Chingam, and ever 
                 since, every year during the 10 days of Onam, the people of Kerala eagerly await their beloved king. 
                 The tale of Mahabali’s sacrifice as described in the folk song “Maveli nadu vaneedum kalam” is 
                 associated with Onam.<br /><br />
                 Even though the story of Mahabali is the most prevalent one related to Onam, there are other such 
                 folktales too. The Kerala Mahatmyam, related to the Brahmandapurana also has a mention of Onam. It 
                 is also found in Pathupattu and Mangudi Maruthanar’s work ‘Madurai Kanji’. Another myth is that which 
                 connects Parashuram to Onam.
